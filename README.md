# GLIE Internship Code
Repository of code that I have made within ITP

- This is a repository of the code I have made within the 13 weeks that I was assigned inside GLIE. The code will be pretty rough, but I will document it by week within this README file

## Week 1
- Untitled.ipynb
  - This file is the ipynb file which has us working with fuzzy searching methods and working together on how to refine its parameters in order to work


## Week 2
- Making a filter for FCA, FET.ipynb
  - this file works on combining FCA file and FET file together, which also starts work with making jobstreet pairing as well. 
- 10 August still working on FET
  - This file continuing on the work done which is mainly testing out basic stuff such as column reconfiguration for the dataset

## Week 3
- 15-8 reading the jobstreet attached data
  - this file continuing on the attaching the jobstreet from previous weeks with my FET and FCA file
- 15-8 reading the population data
  - this file is a test of using population.xlsx for trying to gain more information from the places that we are looking into
- Combining FCI, FET and FCA
  - this is the file in which we start using the code to directly manipulate the master list to fix the names and addresses.
    - some stuff that we do is fixing the names from online, as well as addresses and the company ID.
    - This file is also the making of the final dataset from 8 faculties, saving it into a file named master_df
